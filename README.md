# MovieRentalApp
I have made a backend CustomerStatementService which generates a combination of statements based on the type of movies a customer rented.  
A module for each type of movie is created to calcualte the amount and then generate a statement based on the movies.<br /> 
I have also made unittests which test each of the modules and the whole statement generation process.<br /> 

The things I will do if I have more time:

make unittests for rest of the services and the utility methods.<br /> 
create log methods to mintor steps in the statement build process.<br /> 
I have only made a small part of the web application, the controllers and views are still missing.<br /> 
A docker file is also included in the solution, which can be used to publish to e,g, Azure Docker Registry.
