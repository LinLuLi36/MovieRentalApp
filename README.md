# MovieRentalApp
I have made a backend CustomerStatementService which generates a combination of statements based on the type of movies a customer rented.
I have made a module for each type of movie to calcualte amount and then generate a statement based on it.
I have also made unittests which test each of the modules and the whole statement generation process. 

The things I will do if I have more time:

make unittests for rest of services and utility methods
